After roughly one month you will then be either working job orders that you have developed yourself, or working on house accounts. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>We also have positions for strictly New Business Development for the right person. Straight commission, we need someone who understands that this is a long sales cycle and can realistically go for the first few months with no paycheck. After typically 3 months your pipeline fills up and then the cks can be pretty consistent, however it never changes from being a straight commission position. In 2012 the biggest single commission ck for one month so far has been  $34k. Extremely high earning potential, this is not for the weak of heart! Big dollars, you can make $10k in a day, and lose it in a day if deal falls thru, candidate accepts counter-offer, etc. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>Looking for someone who wants to be in charge of their own destiny.
