Hi there. Are you a Tooling Engineer with 5 + years in injection mold tooling design and development?\rDo you have a 4 year degree (they want engineering, but I don't care if the degree is in basket weaving)?\r\rHere's the thing. I have a client, a very good client, who is looking for an Injection Molding Tooling Engineer. They want an engineering degree and they want someone who has come from a medical device firm (they are a medical device firm). Looking for someone with those qualifications is not like looking for a needle in a haystack, it's like looking for a particular stalk of hay in a haystack.\r\rSo I'm going to cut to the chase. I want to talk with you if you are a Tooling Engineer with injection mold tooling, and if you have any kind of 4 year degree. I don't care about the industry, medical shemidical, \ra precision mold is a precision mold. ( I also want to chat with you if your degree is an AS)\r\rWhat will you do? You will design and validate injection molds, maintain them, work with vendors and work very closely with Quality (they are a medical device company, after all). If you are a Tooling Engineer, you already know what you'll be doing.\r\rMy client is a great company, and the leader in their industry.
